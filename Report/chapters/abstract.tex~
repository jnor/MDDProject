Content Management Systems (CMS) control user-created content in relation to websites, the content is defined by content-types. CMS’s come with predefined content-types, but system specifications may require for customized content-type to be developed. The development of customized content-types is a time-consuming process that involves several manual steps. In this work we analyze three open source CMS’s and present a Model-Driven Development approach for automating the steps required in the development of these customized content-types. The approach focuses on a generic domain-specific language (DSL) called CT-DSL, that enables domain experts to describe content-types at a higher abstraction level.
We present two kinds of evaluations of CT-DSL, an informal software experiment and an online community questionnaire.  We find that the CT-DSL has indeed reduced the time needed for development, but we also find from the questionnaire that the communities do not require the CT-DSL.
